<b>SPU Memory layout (512Kbyte RAM)</b><br>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
As shown above, the first 4Kbytes are used as special capture buffers, and, if
desired, one can also use the Reverb hardware to capture output from other
voice(s).<br>
The SPU memory is not mapped to the CPU bus, it can be accessed only via I/O,
or via DMA transfers (DMA4).<br>
<br>
<b>Voices</b><br>
The SPU has 24 hardware voices. These voices can be used to reproduce sample
data, noise or can be used as frequency modulator on the next voice. Each voice
has it's own programmable ADSR envelope filter. The main volume can be
programmed independently for left and right output.<br>
<br>
<b>Voice Capabilities</b><br>
All 24 voices are having exactly the same capabilities(?), with the exception
that Voice 1 and 3 are having a special Capture feature (see SPU Memory map).<br>
There seems to be no way to produce square waves (without storing a square
wavefrom in memory... although, since SPU RAM isn't connected to the CPU bus,
the "useless" DMA for square wave data wouldn't slowdown the CPU bus)?<br>
<br>
<b>Additional Sound Inputs</b><br>
External Audio can be input (from the Expansion Port?), and the CDROM drive can
be commanded to playback normal Audio CDs (via Play command), or XA-ADPCM
sectors (via Read command), and to pass that data to the SPU.<br>
<br>
<b>Unstable and Delayed I/O</b><br>
The SPU occassionally seems to "miss" I/O writes (not sure if that can be fixed
by any Memory Control settings?), a stable workaround is too write all values
twice (except of course, Fifo writes). The SPU seems to process written values
at 44100Hz rate (so it may take 1/44100 seconds (300h clock cycles) until it
has actually realized the new value).<br>
<br>
<b>Mono/Stereo Audio Output</b><br>
The standard PSX Audio cables have separate Left/Right signals, that is good
for stereo TVs, but, when using a normal mono TV, only one of the two audio
signals (Left or Right) can be connected. PSX programs should thus offer an
option to disable stereo effects, and to output an equal volume to both cables.<br>
<br>
<b>SPU Bus-Width</b><br>
The SPU is connected to a 16bit databus. 8bit/16bit/32bit reads and 16bit/32bit
writes are implemented. However, 8bit writes are NOT implemented: 8bit writes
to ODD addresses are simply ignored (without causing any exceptions), 8bit
writes to EVEN addresses are executed as 16bit writes (eg. "movp r1,12345678h,
movb [spu_port],r1" will write 5678h instead of 78h).<br>
<br>

  SPU ADPCM Samples
</font></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
The SPU supports only ADPCM compressed samples (uncompressed samples seem to be
totally unsupported; leaving apart that one can write uncompressed 16bit PCM
samples to the Reverb Buffer, which can be then output at 22050Hz, as long as
they aren't overwritten by the hardware).<br>
<br>
<b>1F801C06h+N*10h - Voice 0..23 ADPCM Start Address (R/W)</b><br>
This register holds the sample start address (not the current address, ie. the
register doesn't increment during playback).<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  15-0   Startaddress of sound in Sound buffer (in 8-byte units)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
Writing to this register has no effect on the currently playing voice.<br>
The start address is copied to the current address upon Key On.<br>
<br>
<b>1F801C0Eh+N*10h - Voice 0..23 ADPCM Repeat Address (R/W)</b><br>
If the hardware finds an ADPCM header with Loop-Start-Bit, then it copies the
current address to the repeat addresss register.<br>
If the hardware finds an ADPCM header with Loop-Stop-Bit, then it copies the
repeat addresss register setting to the current address; that, &lt;after&gt;
playing the current ADPCM block.<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  15-0  Address sample loops to at end (in 8-byte units)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
Normally, repeat works automatically via the above start/stop bits, and
software doesn't need to deal with the Repeat Address Register. However,
reading from it may be useful to sense if the hardware has reached a start bit,
and writing may be also useful in some cases, eg. to redirect a one-shot sample
(with stop-bit, but without any start-bits) to a silent-loop located elsewhere
in memory.<br>
<br>
<b>Sample Data (SPU-ADPCM)</b><br>
Samples consist of one or more 16-byte blocks:<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  00h       Shift/Filter (reportedly same as for CD-XA) (see there)
  01h       Flag Bits (see below)
  02h       Compressed Data (LSBs=1st Sample, MSBs=2nd Sample)
  03h       Compressed Data (LSBs=3rd Sample, MSBs=4th Sample)
  04h       Compressed Data (LSBs=5th Sample, MSBs=6th Sample)
  ...       ...
  0Fh       Compressed Data (LSBs=27th Sample, MSBs=28th Sample)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<br>
<b>Flag Bits (in 2nd byte of ADPCM Header)</b><br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  0   Loop End    (0=No change, 1=Set ENDX flag and Jump to [1F801C0Eh+N*10h])
  1   Loop Repeat (0=Force Release and set ADSR Level to Zero; only if Bit0=1)
  2   Loop Start  (0=No change, 1=Copy current address to [1F801C0Eh+N*10h])
  3-7 Unknown    (usually 0)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
Possible combinations for Bit0-1 are:<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  Code 0 = Normal     (continue at next 16-byte block)
  Code 1 = End+Mute   (jump to Loop-address, set ENDX flag, Release, Env=0000h)
  Code 2 = Ignored    (same as Code 0)
  Code 3 = End+Repeat (jump to Loop-address, set ENDX flag)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<br>
<b>Looped and One-shot Samples</b><br>
The Loop Start/End flags in the ADPCM Header allow to play one or more sample
block(s) in a loop, that can be either all block(s) endless repeated, or only
the last some block(s) of the sample.<br>
There's no way to stop the output, so a one-shot sample must be followed by
dummy block (with Loop Start/End flags both set, and all data nibbles set to
zero; so that the block gets endless repeated, but doesn't produce any sound).<br>
<br>
<b>SPU-ADPCM vs XA-ADPCM</b><br>
The PSX supports two ADPCM formats: SPU-ADPCM (as described above), and
XA-ADPCM. XA-ADPCM is decompressed by the CDROM Controller, and sent directly
to the sound mixer, without needing to store the data in SPU RAM, nor needing
to use a Voice channel.<br>
The actual decompression algorithm is the same for both formats. However, the
XA nibbles are arranged in different order, and XA uses 2x28 nibbles per block
(instead of 2x14), XA blocks can contain mono or stereo data, XA supports only
two sample rates, and, XA doesn't support looping.<br>

Defines the ADPCM sample rate (1000h = 44100Hz). This register (and PMON) does
affect only the ADPCM sample frequency (but not on the Noise frequency, which
is defined - and shared for all voices - in the SPUCNT register).<br>
<br>
<b>1F801D90h - Voice 0..23 Pitch Modulation Enable Flags (PMON)</b><br>
Pitch modulation allows to generate "Frequency Sweep" effects by mis-using the
amplitude from channel (x-1) as pitch factor for channel (x).<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  0     Unknown... Unused?
  1-23  Flags for Voice 1..23 (0=Normal, 1=Modulate by Voice 0..22)

For example, output a very loud 1Hz sine-wave on channel 4 (with ADSR volume
4000h, and with Left/Right volume=0; unless you actually want to output it to
the speaker). Then additionally output a 2kHz sine wave on channel 5 with
PMON.Bit5 set. The "2kHz" sound should then repeatedly sweep within 1kHz..3kHz
range (or, for a more decent sweep in 1.8kHz..2.2kHz range, drop the ADSR
volume of channel 4).<br>
<br>
<b>Pitch Counter</b><br>
The pitch counter is adjusted at 44100Hz rate as follows:<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  Step = VxPitch                  ;range +0000h..+FFFFh (0...705.6 kHz)
  IF PMON.Bit(x)=1 AND (x&gt;0)      ;pitch modulation enable
    Factor = VxOUTX(x-1)          ;range -8000h..+7FFFh (prev voice amplitude)
    Factor = Factor+8000h         ;range +0000h..+FFFFh (factor = 0.00 .. 1.99)
    Step=SignExpand16to32(Step)   ;hardware glitch on VxPitch&gt;7FFFh, make sign
    Step = (Step * Factor) SAR 15 ;range 0..1FFFFh (glitchy if VxPitch&gt;7FFFh)
    Step=Step AND 0000FFFFh       ;hardware glitch on VxPitch&gt;7FFFh, kill sign
  IF Step&gt;3FFFh then Step=4000h   ;range +0000h..+3FFFh (0.. 176.4kHz)
  Counter = Counter + Step
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
Counter.Bit12 and up indicates the current sample (within a ADPCM block).<br>
Counter.Bit3..11 are used as 8bit gaussian interpolation index.<br>
<br>
<b>Maximum Sound Frequency</b><br>
The Mixer and DAC supports a 44.1kHz output rate (allowing to produce max
22.1kHz tones). The Reverb unit supports only half the frequency.<br>
The pitch counter supports sample rates up to 176.4kHz. However, exceeding the
44.1kHz limit causes the hardware to skip samples (or actually: to apply
incomplete interpolation on the 'skipped' samples).<br>
VxPitch can be theoretically 0..FFFFh (max 705.6kHz), normally 4000h..FFFFh are
simply clipped to max=4000h (176.4kHz). Except, 4000h..FFFFh could be used with
pitch modulation (as they are multiplied by 0.00..1.99 before clipping; in
practice this works only for 4000h..7FFFh; as values 8000h..FFFFh are mistaken
as signed values).<br>
<br>
<b>4-Point Gaussian Interpolation</b><br>
Interpolation is applied on the 4 most recent 16bit ADPCM samples
(new,old,older,oldest), using bit4-11 of the pitch counter as 8bit
interpolation index (i=00h..FFh):<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  out =       ((gauss[0FFh-i] * oldest) SAR 15)
  out = out + ((gauss[1FFh-i] * older)  SAR 15)
  out = out + ((gauss[100h+i] * old)    SAR 15)
  out = out + ((gauss[000h+i] * new)    SAR 15)

The PSX table is slightly bugged: Theoretically, each four values
(gauss[000h+i], gauss[0FFh-i], gauss[100h+i], gauss[1FFh-i]) should sum up to
8000h, but in practice they do sum up to 7F7Fh..7F81h (fortunately the PSX sum
doesn't exceed the 8000h limit; meaning that the PSX interpolations won't
overflow, which has been a hardware glitch on the SNES).<br>

Sweep is another Volume envelope, additionally to the ADSR volume envelope
(unlike ADSR, sweep can be used for stereo effects, such like blending from
left to right).<br>
Sweep starts at the current volume (which can be set via Bit15=0, however,
caution - the Bit15=0 setting isn't applied until the next 44.1kHz cycle; so
setting the initial level with Bit15=0, followed by the sweep parameter with
Bit15=1 works only if there's a suitable delay between the two operations).
Once when sweep is started, the current volume level increases to +7FFFh, or
decreases to 0000h.<br>
Sweep Phase should be equal to the sign of the current volume (not yet tested,
in the negative mode it does probably "increase" to -7FFFh?). The Phase bit
seems to have no effect in Exponential Decrease mode.<br>

Reportedly Release can go down to -1 (FFFFh), but that isn't true; and release
ends at 0... or does THAT depend on an END flag found in the sample-data?<br>
The register is read/writeable, writing allows to let the ADSR generator to

overwrite the setting (from another internal register) whenever applying a new

done by any games, but it is done by the BIOS intro; observe that waiting for
SPUCNT writes being applied in SPUSTAT won't work in that case (since SPUCNT
was already in manual write mode from previous block), so one must instead use
some hardcoded delay of at least 300h cycles; the BIOS is using a much longer

With [1F801014h].bit24-27=zero, reading SPU RAM via DMA works glitchy:<br>
The first received halfword within each block is FFFFh. So with a DMA blocksize
of 10h words (=20h halfwords), the following is received:<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  1st block:   FFFFh, halfwords[00h..1Eh]
  2nd block:   FFFFh, halfwords[20h..3Eh]
  etc.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
that'd theoretically match the SPU Fifo Size, but, because of the inserted
FFFFh value, the last Fifo entry isn't received, ie. halfword[1Fh,3Fh] are
lost. As a workaround, one can increase the DMA blocksize to 11h words, and
then the following is received:<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  1st block:   FFFFh, halfwords[00h..1Eh], twice halfword[1Fh]
  2nd block:   FFFFh, halfwords[20h..3Eh], twice halfword[3Fh]
  etc.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
this time, all data is received, but after the transfer one must still remove
the FFFFh values, and the duplicated halfwords by software. Aside from the
&lt;inserted&gt; FFFFh values there are occassionaly some unstable halfwords
ORed by FFFFh (or ORed by other garbage values), this can be fixed by using
"rep2" mode, which does then receive:<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  1st block:   FFFFh, halfwords[00h,00h,..0Eh,0Eh], triple halfword[0Fh]
  2nd block:   FFFFh, halfwords[10h,10h,..1Eh,1Eh], triple halfword[1Fh]
  etc.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
again, remove the first halfword (FFFFh) and the last halfword, and, take the
duplicated halfwords ANDed together. Unstable values occur only every 32
halfwords or so (probably when the SPU is simultaneously reading ADPCM data),
but do never occur on two continous halfwords, so, even if one halfword was
ORed by garbage, the other halfword is always correct, and the result of the
ANDed halfwords is 100% stable.<br>
Note: The unstable reading does NOT occur always, when resetting the PSX a
couple of times it does occassionally boot-up with totally stable reading,
since there is no known way to activate the stable "mode" via I/O ports, the
stable/unstable behaviour does eventually depend on internal clock
dividers/multipliers, and whether they are starting in sync with the CPU or
not.<br>
Caution: The "rep2" trick cannot be used in combination with reverb (reverb
seems to be using the Port 1F801DACh Sound RAM Data Transfer Control, too).<br>

See also: SPUCNT (IRQ enable/disable/acknowledge) and SPUSTAT (IRQ flag).<br>
<br>
<b>Voice Interrupt</b><br>
Triggers an IRQ when a voice reads ADPCM data from the IRQ address.<br>
Mind that ADPCM cannot be stopped (uh, except, probably they CAN be stopped, by
setting the sample rate to zero?), all voices are permanently reading data from
SPU RAM - even in Noise mode, even if the Voice Volume is zero, and even if the
ADSR pattern has finished the Release period - so even inaudible voices can
trigger IRQs. To prevent unwanted IRQs, best set all unused voices to an
endless looped dummy ADPCM block.<br>
For stable IRQs, the IRQ address should be aligned to the 16-byte ADPCM blocks.
If if the IRQ address is in the middle of a 16-byte ADPCM block, then the IRQ
doesn't seem to trigger always (unknown why, but it seems to occassionally miss
IRQs, even if the block gets repeated several times).<br>
<br>
<b>Capture Interrupt</b><br>
Setting the IRQ address to 0000h..01FFh (aka byte address 00000h..00FFFh) will
trigger IRQs on writes to the four capture buffers. Each of the four buffers
contains 400h bytes (=200h samples), so the IRQ rate will be around 86.13Hz
(44100Hz/200h).<br>
CD-Audio capture is always active (even CD-Audio output is disabld in SPUCNT,
and even if the drive door is open). Voice capture is (probably) also always
active (even if the corresponding voice is off).<br>
Capture IRQs do NOT occur if 1F801DACh.bit3-2 are both zero.<br>
<br>
<b>Reverb Interrupt</b><br>
Reverb is also triggering interrupts if the IRQ address is located in the
reverb buffer area. Unknown &lt;which&gt; of the various reverb read(s) and/or
reverb write(s) are triggering interrupts.<br>
<br>
<b>Data Transfers</b><br>
Data Transfers (usually via DMA4) to/from SPU-RAM do also trap SPU interrupts.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
IRQ Address is used by Metal Gear Solid, Legend of Mana, Tokimeki Memorial 2,
Crash Team Racing, The Misadventures of Tron Bonne, and (somewhat?) by Need For
Speed 3.<br>

All volume registers are signed 16bit (range -8000h..+7FFFh).<br>
All src/dst/disp/base registers are addresses in SPU memory (divided by 8),
src/dst are relative to the current buffer address, the disp registers are
relative to src registers, the base register defines the start address of the
reverb buffer (the end address is fixed, at 7FFFEh). Writing a value to mBASE

Sets reverb for the channel. As soon as the sample ends, the reverb for that
channel is turned off... that's fine, but WHEN does it end?<br>
In Reverb mode, the voice seems to output BOTH normal (immediately) AND via
Reverb (delayed).<br>
<br>
<b>Reverb Bits in SPUCNT Register (R/W)</b><br>
The SPUCNT register contains a Reverb Master Enable flag, and Reverb Enable
flags for External Audio input and CD Audio input.<br>
When the Reverb Master Enable flag is cleared, the SPU stops to write any data
to the Reverb buffer (that is useful when zero-filling the reverb buffer;
ensuring that already-zero values aren't overwritten by still-nonzero values).<br>
However, the Reverb Master Enable flag does not disable output from Reverb
buffer to the speakers (that might be useful to output uncompressed 22050Hz
samples) (otherwise, to disable the buffer output, set the Reverb Output volume
to zero and/or zerofill the reverb buffer).<br>

<br>
<b>Notes</b><br>
The values written to memory are saturated to -8000h..+7FFFh.<br>
The multiplication results are divided by +8000h, to fit them to 16bit range.<br>
All memory addresses are relative to the current BufferAddress, and wrapped
within mBASE..7FFFEh when exceeding that region.<br>
All data in the Reverb buffer consists of signed 16bit samples. The Left and
Right Reverb Buffer addresses should be choosen so that one half of the buffer
contains Left samples, and the other half Right samples (ie. the data is
L,L,L,L,... R,R,R,R,...; it is NOT interlaced like L,R,L,R,...), during
operation, when the buffer address increases, the Left half will overwrite the
older samples of the Right half, and vice-versa.<br>
The reverb hardware spends one 44100h cycle on left calculations, and the next
44100h cycle on right calculations (unlike as shown in the above formula, where
left/right are shown simultaneously at 22050Hz).<br>
<br>
<b>Reverb Disable</b><br>
SPUCNT.bit7 disables writes to reverb buffer, but reads from reverb buffer do
still occur. If vAPF2 is zero then it does simply read "Lout=[mLAPF2-dAPF2]"
and "Rout=[mRAPF2-dAPF2]". If vAPF2 is nonzero then it does additionally use
data from APF1, if vAPF1 and vAPF2 are both nonzero then it's also using data
from COMB. However, the SAME/DIFF stages aren't used when reverb is disabled.<br>
<br>
<b>Bug</b><br>
vIIR works only in range -7FFFh..+7FFFh. When set to -8000h, the multiplication
by -8000h is still done correctly, but, the final result (the value written to
memory) gets negated (this is a pretty strange feature, it is NOT a simple
overflow bug, it does affect the "+[mLSAME-2]" addition; although that part
normally shouldn't be affected by the "*vIIR" multiplication). Similar effects
might (?) occur on some other volume registers when they are set to -8000h.<br>
<br>
<b>Speed of Sound</b><br>
The speed of sound is circa 340 meters per second (in dry air, at room
temperature). For example, a voice that travels to a wall at 17 meters
distance, and back to its origin, should have a delay of 0.1 seconds.<br>

even when reverb master enable is zero). Also, when not using reverb, Port

The bytes at 1F801DBCh and 1F801E60h usually have the above values on
cold-boot. The registers are read/write-able, although writing any values to
them doesn't seem to have any effect on sound output. Also, the SPU doesn't
seem to modify the registers at any time during sound output, nor reverb
calculations, nor activated external audio input... the registers seem to be
just some kind of general-purpose RAM.<br>
